## Technical Notes for AI Generation:

1. **Style consistency**: Maintain documentary/photojournalistic approach for authenticity
2. **Color psychology**: Use warm tones for hope, cool tones for challenges, gold for wealth concentration
3. **Composition**: Always include human element for emotional connection
4. **Aspect ratios**: 
   - Hero images: 16:9 for web headers
   - Social media: 1:1 for Instagram, 9:16 for Stories
   - Print: 3:2 for traditional media
5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Ensure respectful representation of all economic classes
6. **Avoid**: Poverty porn, stereotypes, overly dramatic or exploitative imagery
